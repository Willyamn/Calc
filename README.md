Python List Operations
This is a simple Python program that demonstrates basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding an index in a list.

Features
The program performs the following steps:
Creates an empty list called my_list.
Appends elements 10, 20, 30, 40.
Inserts the value 15 at the second position.
Extends the list with [50, 60, 70].
Removes the last element.
Sorts the list in ascending order.
Finds and prints the index of the value 30.

Example Output
Final List: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3

Concepts Covered
append() – Add element to the end of a list.
insert() – Insert element at a specific index.
extend() – Add multiple elements from another list.
pop() – Remove the last element.
sort() – Sort the list in ascending order.
